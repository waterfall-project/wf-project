"""Derive, from the bundled contract, the variant the fake back serves (US-0030).

Usage: ``python -m wftools.mock BUNDLE``, where BUNDLE is the contract bundled as JSON; the
file is rewritten in place.

Two differences, and only these, so that the fake back answers what the contract says:

- every path is prefixed with the path of the contract's server, ``/api/v1``: Prism serves
  paths at the root and ignores a relative server, and the front must call the fake back
  exactly as it will call the real service;
- no operation requires a bearer token: the fake back answers whoever calls it, as the account
  the mock-up starts from, and authentication is the real service's (EP-03).

No response is written here: responses are the examples of the contract.
